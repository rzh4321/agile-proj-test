# SoHo Route Generator

## Description
The **SoHo Route Generator** is a mobile web application that creates custom shopping routes in SoHo, New York, based on users' fashion preferences and budgets. Users can discover stores using various filters, view detailed store information, and save their favorites. The app then generates the most time-efficient routes and provides options to save or share their shopping plan.

This app is designed to improve the experience of shopping in a large, busy, and scattered area like SoHo, making it especially useful for shoppers with limited time or specific preferences.
